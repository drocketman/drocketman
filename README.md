- 👋 Hi, I’m @drocketman
- 👀 I’m interested in planetary geology, astronomy, remote sensing, geomorphology, astrobiology, and the icy moons/objects in our solar system
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new methods to probe the icy objects of our solar system by studying Earth-based analogs and the signals we detect.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things related to Europa!
- 📫 How to reach me: dab444@cornell.edu
